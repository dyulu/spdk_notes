# SPDK based user space NVMe over TCP Transport Solution (SDC 2019)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMddPZ5gd2I&t=5s
SPDK implements both TCP transport in host and target side
Introduce some techniques for the further performance improvement of SPDK's solution, e.g., 
  (1) leveraging user space TCP stack (e.g., VPP + DPDK) to replace the kernel TCP stack;
  (2) leveraging some features of hardware such as ADQ on Intel's E810 NIC.

==== Key-Value Operations
Storing
  Data is stored as a single value associated with a key
    Not updatable in place
    Not extendable in place
    Complete value
Retrieving
  Data is retrieved as a single value associated with a key
    Could be portion of value
Deleting
  Key-Value pair may be deleted
Listing
  Able to list all Keys stored on the device
